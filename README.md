# Working with files Overhaul C++

This DLL is written on enthusiasm because I'm tired of copying code for some file manipulation

But my knowledge of C ++ is still not enough, so edits are accepted within reason (and as you understand, my English is also not very smooth).

The library so far implements only simple work with files (get file size in bytes, write and read all bytes, etc.).

In the future I will add new features.
